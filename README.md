# Keycloak + React Frontend Example

This project will show the basic usage of an OIDC authentication using `react-oidc-context`.
Also, there is a little interactive map. 

## What to do:

- Clone this repo
- Install packages with `npm install`
- Run the server with `npm start`

This Frontend MUST be used with [this](https://github.com/loryphone205/keycloak_backend_example) project to test the authentication process.
